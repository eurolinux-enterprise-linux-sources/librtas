Librtas provides a set of libraries for user-space access to the
Run-Time Abstraction Services (RTAS) on the ppc64 architecture.

librtas.so
This library that allows user-space programs to make RTAS calls which 
provide support for low-level system hardware configuration and operations, 
such as getting hardware sensor (temp, fan speed, etc.) data, setting the 
operator panel LEDS, getting hardware error logs, injecting artificial 
hardware errors (for testing), getting VPD (Vital Product Data), and 
loading new firmware.

librtasevent.so
This library provides a set of definitions and useful routines for
analyzing RTAS events, such as parsing out the sections of an RTAS event
and printing the contents of a RTAS event in human-readable form (used
by many of the RAS tools on ppc64).

Building & Installing:
